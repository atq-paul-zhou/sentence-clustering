# sentence-clustering

Sentence clustering using various clustering algorithms

Current algorithms:
   1. Kmeans
   2. Affinity
   
To run the code:
1. run main.py
2. To test kmeans clustering, change the algo to `clusters = sent_clus.kmeas_clustering(sents, nclusters)` in main.py
3. To test affinity clustering, change the algo to `clusters = sent_clus.kmeas_clustering(sents, nclusters)` in main.py


Note: If you want to run the algorithms in different python files and test it, kindly check the "python files" folder.
